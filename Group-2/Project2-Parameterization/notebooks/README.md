**Project summary:** In this project, we expand on the work of Sane et al. and train various neural network models with the overarching goal of improving the parameterization of vertical ocean mixing. We extend the project in two main ways. Firstly, with principle component analysis (PCA) which led to efficiency in training but greater loss. Secondly, with Gaussian process regression which resulted in improvements in predictive power.

**Contribution statement:** All group members approve of the submitted work. Everyone contributed in various ways. Juan tested several graphical neural networks. He also implemented PCA/ICA to improve efficiency. Kefeng developed a sparse Gaussian process regression. Yutong also worked on a Gaussian feature layer and Gaussian Mixture Model. Sam helped refine the models and summarized everyone's work into a data story.
